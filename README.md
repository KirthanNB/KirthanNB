### 💡 About Me

Hi there! I'm Kirthan N B, a Computer Science and Engineering student at UVCE with a strong passion for building meaningful tech. I love exploring the endless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and modern Web Development.

I'm currently sharpening my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, while also diving into backend development using Python and Flask. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects — whether it's a smart assistant, a web app, or a tool that solves a real problem.

I'm always curious, always learning — especially in the field of AI, where I believe technology can be made smarter, more accessible, and more impactful.
